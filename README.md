### App Description
The app pairs carriers of the Naloxone drug with people in their communities who need it most.

Naloxone is an antidote for an opioid overdose, whether from prescription opioids or heroin.  It is a prescription drug with few side effects that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdoses.  Although most frequently used in emergency rooms and on ambulances, many states have recently taken steps to make it easier for people in the general public, including family and friends of drug users, to carry and administer naloxone. 

The app has two main use cases: to pair those who are experiencing an overdose with someone in their community that is a carrier of the naloxone drug, and to educate its users on the general topic of opiod drugs and how overdoses can be avoided.
